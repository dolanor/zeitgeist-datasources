Zeitgeist extension for Firefox
===============================


How to run this extension
*************************

Two possible ways:

1.) run `make` and open the resulting `Zeitgeist-nightly.xpi` with firefox

2.) First create a file called .moz_profile which contains the path to
    the configuration directory of the firefox profile you would like
    to use for testing this extension.
        echo /home/<username>/.mozilla/firefox/<random>.<profile name> > .moz_profile
    This step is optional, per default the 'default' profile for the
    current user is used.
    The second step is a simple as running
        make devel
    This will register the current branch as extension. If zeitgeist is
    installed system-wide, this command will get the source of zeitgeist
    and symlink the containing zeitgeist modul properly.
    
    
This extension needs either a running zeitgeist-daemon or a
'org.gnome.zeitgeist.service' in the configuration env of the
dbus service.
